            <h2>Tamagotchi</h2>
            <p>I have created this tamagotchi website for a development course using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The theme is based on different TV shows, every time you refresh the browser, you will get a different TV character. All the illustrations are created with Adobe Illustrator. </p>

            <p>I created these designs in the process of building a mobile application for the International Student Guide Amsterdam, using HTML and CSS. The concept of this app, is that international students can meet with local students to get Dutch lessons.</p>

            <h2>Prime Travels</h2>
            <p>The assignment we received with this project, was to design a multi-device web application for a travel experience. The application includes where does the user want to go, what do they want to experience, what things do they want to do when they are traveling, what do they need to see, have other people been there and do they have any tips? This prototype is created with Adobe XD.</p>
